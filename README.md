## TO DO
At this point, basically everything still needs to be done.
* CPU Emulation
* Memory Emulation (including RAM, ROM and bank switching)
* Video Output (probably involving LCDC emulation)
* Sound Output (certainly involving sound hardware emulation)
* Filesystem Interactions (config file, ROM loading, and save file management)

I may move the To Do list into a Trello board when things become more taskable, or if someone else joins the project. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
