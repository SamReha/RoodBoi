## TO DO
At this point, basically everything still needs to be done.
* CPU Emulation
 * Currently in-progress
* Memory Emulation (including RAM, ROM and bank switching)
 * Complete for now (though I suspect external RAM may need to be updated to support bank switching)
* Video Output (probably involving LCDC emulation)
* Sound Output (certainly involving sound hardware emulation)
* Filesystem Interactions (config file, ROM loading, and save file management)
 * ROMs can be loaded successfully, though save states and config file are still to-do.

I may move the To Do list into a Trello board when things become more taskable, or if someone else joins the project. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.
